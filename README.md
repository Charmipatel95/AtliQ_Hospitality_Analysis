## :memo: Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## :mortar_board:	Learning from this Project 
- It seems like many hotels have a common cancellation policy where guests can cancel their booking without any charge as long as it's done before three months prior to the booking date. However, if the cancellation happens after that timeframe, guests might incur a fee ranging from 60 to 90% of the total booking cost.
- I've become adept at utilizing bookmarks and selections to fulfill diverse needs. One notable application is how I've streamlined page navigation within the dashboard, leveraging these tools to enhance efficiency.
- I have learned that in hotel industry follow three types of pricing Flat pricing, Weekday / Weekend pricing , Dynamic pricing. It is advisable that business should adapt Weekday / Weekend pricing or Dynamic pricing in order to increase the business.

## ‚úçüèª Some Important insights from the Dashboard

Here are some key insights gleaned from the Dashboard:

- Mumbai emerges as the top revenue generator, raking in 669 million, closely trailed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
- AtliQ Exotica stands out among the seven property types, boasting impressive figures: 320 million in revenue, a rating of 3.62, occupancy at 57.3%, and a 24.4% cancellation rate.
- AtliQ Blu boasts the highest occupancy rate at 62%.
- Week 24 stands as the peak revenue-generating period, clocking in at 139.58 million.
- Delhi leads the pack in both occupancy and rating, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
- Elite room types witness the highest number of bookings but also experience a notable cancellation rate.
- A clear correlation emerges between Rating and Occupancy, indicating a strong positive relationship. Hotels with lower ratings tend to have lower occupancy rates.
- Similarly, a significant negative correlation is evident between Rating and Cancellation Rate. Hotels with lower ratings often experience higher cancellation rates.
